    <h1>There's a Treasure in you that you Must Learn About</h1>
</div>
<h2>Hello, I want to introduce myself, maybe you already know me

    and know of my existence. I am the same age as you, was born
    
    next to you and have been at your side all this time I am your
    
    soul. And although I live within you I am not counted as part of
    
    your body because I am not made of flesh and take a spiritual
    
    form and an immortal, we are completely different your body and
    
    me. Your body will return to dust from where which it was
    
    created and I will stay waiting for the day of final judgment where
    
    I will be judged according to your deeds. That is why I suffer,
    
    seeing that you do not value me nor give me the importance I
    
    deserve; you don't nourish me and I am becoming weaker. My
    
    nourishment is prayer, obedience to God, and following the road
    
    of righteousness, that helps me and fortifies me.
    
    Please, help save me, don't ignore my clamor, nor invest yourself too much to this life, because it may be that your faith will be like the man who through hard work in this world stored away many riches and did not prepare himself for what is most important, and the Lord said to him, "Stubborn, tonight they come to ask for your soul, and what you have stored away, for whom will it be?"
    
    That is why I ask you to leave the path of evil and become closer to Jesus Christ. Search first and foremost the kingdom of God and its justice and all the other things will come as a result of it. Help save me and don't let me be condemned, I am your soul...

    <h2>What is the soul? The soul is the part of man that thinks, feels, and has hope.</h2>
    
    <h3>1 Samuel 18:1/ And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</h3>
    
    <h2>The soul is not the body, nor the spirit.</h2>
    
    <h3>I Thessalonians 5:23/ And
    
    the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
    
    whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
    
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Matthew 10:28/ And fear not
    
    them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but
    
    rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</h3>
    
    <h2>The soul and the body are two distinct entities.</h2>
    
    <h3>Hebrews 4:12/ For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
    
    two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</h3>
    
    <h2>The soul will be saved, not the body or the spirit:</h2>
    
    <h3>A) The body will not enter the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 15:50</h3>
    
    <h3>B) The Spirit returns to God. Ecclesiastes 12:7</h3>
    
    <h3>C) The soul will be saved. James 1:21; Mark 8:36, 37; Psalms 12:7; Peter 1:9</h3>
    
    <h2>The soul is what receives purification.</h2>
    <h3>1 Peter 1:22/ Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently</h3>
